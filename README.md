# nodejs_test
both get and post request are success.

The post body is not rigth. Here is the body.

{
  id: 'c7a70599-bd1a-482b-93f0-b41ea7aaafba',
  result: -15141936949340192
}

I commend out the continue api call. Every two seconds, it called once. 

eslint should work. But, there are some error, since "require" is undefined.
